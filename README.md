## Technologies Used:

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write _something_. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## How It's Made:

### 3D ThreeJS AI Showcase

This is a web application that demonstrates how corporations can use 3D graphics to showcase their products. It uses ThreeJS, React Three Fiber, TailwindCSS and Framer Motion to create a seamless and engaging user experience.

- Interactive 3D models of products.
- Customizable backgrounds and lighting.
- Smooth camera transitions and animations.
- Responsive design that works on all devices.

<br>
<br>

## Scaffolding Your First Vite Project with React

```terminal
 > npm create vite@latest ./ -- --template react client
 > cd my-project (client)
```

## Installing Your Packages

```terminal
  > npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei maath valtio react-color framer-motion
```

  - [React Three Drei useful addons]()
  - [Maath math helpers]()
  - [Valtio manage react state]()
  - [React color picker]()
  - [Framer for animations]()

## Install Tailwind CSS

> Install tailwindcss and its peer dependencies, then generate your tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js files.

```terminal
 > npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
 > npx tailwindcss init -p
```

## Configure your template paths

> Add the paths to all of your template files in your tailwind.config.js file.

```terminal
 /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

<br>
<br>

## Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS

> Add the @tailwind directives for each of Tailwind‚Äôs layers to your ./src/index.css file.

```terminal
>  @tailwind base;
>  @tailwind components;
>  @tailwind utilities;
```

## Optimizations

_(optional)_

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those _whoa this is awesome_ or _fuck yeah I did it!_ moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
